_Hi! Welcome to the second edition of my newsletter! The response to this has been WAY more positive than I expected, and I just wanted to say thanks for signing up - I hope you have a good time here:) Let's get on with this week's essay!_

## On helpful and not-so-helpful advice I've received

For many writers, stories seem to boil down to information conveyor belts. So much writing advice boils down to _"follow this formula, and your story too can be great!"_ and what sucks is that so many of us seem to believe it when we're starting out.

After talking to my friend Connie about this recently, I realized the way this kind of advice blocks me up isn't a personal issue but rather a shared experience - the promise of a "perfect" story that just works is an especially attractive one. 

_"If you simply pose 'x' as a question at the beginning of a film, then answer it through a series of contrived events, you'll have a perfect story."_

And that I think is just not what a good story is - more than lessons, advice, or ideas (although those are all GREAT!), stories (films) are _"moving paintings we get to ooo and aaa at and glean our own understandings from" (_[_link_](https://twitter.com/BREADSWORD/status/1690118781698473984?s=20)_)_, creating a connection between director and audience.

## So, how do we approach telling stories instead?

_Theater Camp (as recommended by Nicole)_

As any good thespian does, when starting a story, I would put together my theme, gather my characters and setting, and mechanically execute the story I was telling - inevitably ending up with a deterministic answer to the question I started with. 

Instead of using structure as a starting point, I would rigidly stick to it. Every piece of the story that didn't conform had to get out. And, while I'm sure that works for some people, to me, it seems to produce stories that might as well be blog posts (as in _"information delivered to you in as efficient as possible way"_).

I think this stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the hero's journey - _a lot of great stories share the three-act structure, have a midpoint and an "all is lost", but rather than being "prerequisites" to a good story, they are more like goal-posts to aim for_.

Great stories, more than information conveyor belts, react to and are in constant conversation with themselves - something that can only happen if we, as the writer/director/artist, allow ourselves the freedom to experience the story as it unfolds rather than just forging on ahead, following our predetermined theme.

When I started writing that way, I found out, of all things, that **stories are much easier to write when you let them be imperfect**. All it takes is to trust that when we feel excited as we write a passage, the audience will feel that through the screen. More than just a theme or idea, writing stories that way creates something bigger than the sum of its parts - a connection.

See you in a few weeks!
